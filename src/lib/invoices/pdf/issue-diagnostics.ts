 * Production Observability Correction 1 — bounded, non-disclosing

 * its two PDF download routes (staff and Portal). Reuses Stability
 * Correction F5's own audited principle exactly (see
 * src/lib/client-portal/analytics-events.ts's own header comment): a
 * fixed, stable event key plus one or more allowlisted enum fields only
 * — never the caught error, never any identifier, never
 * message/stack/cause/digest/Prisma metadata/provider response/Storage
 * error detail, never an Invoice number/email/URL/Storage path/signed
 * URL/filename/token/environment value/request data. This is not a
 * generic logging framework — two narrow, closed-enum functions, kept
 * local to the Invoice/PDF subsystem, mirroring the single allowlisted
 * `classification` field F5 already established as this codebase's own
 * precedent for exactly this kind of signal.
 *
 * `src/app/api/invoices/[id]/pdf/route.ts` and
 * `src/app/api/portal/invoices/[id]/pdf/route.ts` each carry their own
 * static security-check assertion ("contains no console logging of any
 * kind" — scripts/security-checks/check-invoice-issue-security.mjs
 * checks #11h/#13j) against their own raw file text. Both routes call
 * `logInvoicePdfLedgerMismatch` below (a plain function call, never the
 * literal text `console.`) rather than logging directly, so that
 * existing invariant continues to hold unmodified — deliberate, not
 * incidental.
