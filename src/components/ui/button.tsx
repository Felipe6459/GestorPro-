/**
 * Two mutually exclusive, non-overlapping class sets — never combined with
 * a caller's own color-override className. A caller that instead appended
 * "bg-white text-gray-900 ..." on top of this component's own hardcoded
 * "bg-black ... text-white" produced a genuine, reproduced production bug:
 * Tailwind's own generated stylesheet order (which utility "wins" a
 * same-specificity conflict) is a build-time/content-scan-order detail,
 * not something a className string's own left-to-right order controls —
 * confirmed directly, this resolved to bg-white winning for
 * background-color while the base text-white still won for color,
 * rendering literally invisible white-on-white button text (see Invoice
 * System Slice 4 post-deploy correction — the reported "empty rectangle"
 * Issue/Send buttons). `variant` sidesteps the whole class of bug
 * structurally: exactly one variant's own class string is ever rendered,
 * so the two rule sets can never both be present to conflict at all.
 * Default (`primary`) is byte-identical to this component's previous sole
 * appearance, so no existing caller's rendered output changes.
